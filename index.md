And, what about if I write something like this?
I have been also reading documentation about types of text so let me check:

If I'm not wrong, this should be **bold**
And this should be *italic*

Perfet!!

~~This will appear as striketrough~~

**Then bold _with nested italic_ in this line**

***Now, both bold and italic***

What about <sub>subscripts</sub> and <sup>superscripts</sup>

Then this is a list:
- Number one
* Number two
+ Numebr three

Odered list:
1. Hello
2. Hi
3. Yup

Nested list:
1. Something
   - second line
     - third line

And finally, links

I wonder how this will be displayed after writting all this stuff.

PD: okey, I have seen the preview and I have noticed that for text formating (bold, italic, ...) you should not put an space between characters, but for lists you should if not it doesn't work.
I guess I'll be starting to have confidence with these rules as soon as I start practice a little bit more.
And also learning more advanced stuff.


Let's continue with the course.


## Part 2 of the course: Add images.

Here I should include an image

I will include a couple of them, I dont now if I can just put a random link from teh internet or not

Let's check.
First the image from the course:

![Image of Yaktocat](https://octodex.github.com/images/yaktocat.png)

Then let's support your local football clubs. In my case **Unionistas de Salamanca**

And finally, I don't know, a meme about acemoglu

![meme daron acemoglu](https://preview.redd.it/citing-marx-citing-acemoglu-v0-cj4pfprjbzsd1.jpeg?auto=webp&s=80dc79dce7e1039bd8164394b50ae58f740b463c)


I have noticed that not all web pages actually work to show an image. The last two comes from Reddit. I tried also Pinterest or Twitter and it was not working


## Part 3 of the course: Add code blocks.

I'll include the two exampls shown in the course.

#### Example 1 (git lenguage (?))
```
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/skills/Projects/recipe-repository/.git/
```

### Example 2 (javascript lenguage)
``` javascript
var myVar = "Hello, world!";
```


I would like to learn if I can write in R here or in Stata, but I think this is advanced. Let's check other day :)


## Part 4 of the course: Add task lists.

This is an example of a task list
- [x] Create GitHub account
- [x] Don't know what can I do here
- [x] Start some courses to learn
- [ ] Improve my home page
- [ ] Be an expert on git
