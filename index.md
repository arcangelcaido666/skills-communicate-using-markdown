And, what about if I write something like this?
I have been also reading documentation about types of text so let me check:

If I'm not wrong, this should be **bold**
And this should be *italic*

Perfet!!

~~This will appear as striketrough~~

**Then bold _with nested italic_ in this line**

***Now, both bold and italic***

What about <sub>subscripts</sub> and <sup>superscripts</sup>

Then this is a list:
- Number one
* Number two
+ Numebr three

Odered list:
1. Hello
2. Hi
3. Yup

Nested list:
1. Something
   - second line
     - third line

And finally, links

I wonder how this will be displayed after writting all this stuff.

PD: okey, I have seen the preview and I have noticed that for text formating (bold, italic, ...) you should not put an space between characters, but for lists you should if not it doesn't work.
I guess I'll be starting to have confidence with these rules as soon as I start practice a little bit more.
And also learning more advanced stuff.


Let's continue with the course.
